With numerous moving metal parts, it is crucial to keep them lubricated to minimize friction and prevent breakdown. Our expert technicians know the importance of transmission fluid and how it protects your car&#x27;s transmission. As time goes by and miles accumulate, the fluid loses its protective properties, leading to the breakdown of parts and metal flakes throughout the fluid, causing increased friction and heat. That is why we recommend regular automatic transmission service to avoid expensive repairs or replacements. Trust Taharish for reliable and affordable transmission service to keep your car running smoothly.</p></div><div class="Services_serviceSection__xp2Fp"><h2 class="Services_serviceTitle__o2BUM">Cooling System</h2><p class="Services_serviceDescription__z0X1m">Taharish understands the importance of maintaining your car&#x27;s cooling system to avoid costly repairs. The system comprises the radiator, hoses, and coolant that flow through the engine and transmission to prevent overheating. An overheated engine can result in repairs that cost thousands of dollars. That&#x27;s why the coolant/anti-freeze is crucial, as it minimizes friction between metal components to prevent overheating and serious damage. At Taharish, we recommend periodic inspections and maintenance to ensure the cooling system is functioning correctly. We also test the coolant&#x27;s performance to optimize its protective properties. Additionally, we recommend flushing out old fluids and replacing them with new ones every 1.5 to 2 years. Don&#x27;t delay, visit Taharish to protect your car and save money on costly repairs.</p></div><div class="Services_serviceSection__xp2Fp"><h2 class="Services_serviceTitle__o2BUM">3D Wheel Alignment</h2><p class="Services_serviceDescription__z0X1m">At Taharish, we understand the importance of correct wheel alignment for optimal road holding and extended tyre life. In most cases, aligning the front two wheels is sufficient, but for vehicles with a multi-link or independent rear suspension, all four wheels need to be aligned. Incorrect wheel alignment can lead to a host of problems such as reduced tyre life, poor handling, and increased fuel consumption. We use advanced 3D wheel alignment technology to ensure precise and accurate alignment, allowing you to enjoy a smoother, safer, and more fuel-efficient ride. Whether your vehicle pulls to one side or you want to extend your tyre life, our expert technicians can provide the wheel alignment your vehicle needs.</p></div><div class="Services_serviceSection__xp2Fp"><h2 class="Services_serviceTitle__o2BUM">Electrical Repairs</h2><p class="Services_serviceDescription__z0X1m">Modern vehicles rely heavily on complex electrical systems to operate.
